# emotion-detection-of-text-using-machine-learning-and-python
Base on the text, which is classified as 'anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'joy', 'neutral', 'sadness', 'shame',  'surprise', these best represent the emotion of the writer. 
 
In this project we will be running a text classification, to understand the emotions between a particular emotion/text, although this is similar to sentiment analysis (this is just base on polarity of Positive, Negative or Neutral) but  emotion detection is we are trying to tell emotion of the writers. Sit back and enjoy the ride.

Why is it needed? 
Emotion detection can be such important analysis to help companies to understand what their consumers feel and how they react their product and services. Most times it takes happy staffs to have happy customers, it can also help in dectating the emotions of employee, with little modiifcation by using Tensorflow we can use this for face detection, mask detection and more.

To understand the honest, pain, dissatifaction, opinion and reviews of your business, it's expedient for companies to use this algorithms to make the right decision(s), understand who their customer/consumers are and how they feel using your product and/or services.
