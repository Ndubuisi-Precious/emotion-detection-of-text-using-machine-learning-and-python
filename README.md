# emotion-detection-of-text-using-machine-learning-and-python
Base on the text, which is classified as 'anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'joy', 'neutral', 'sadness', 'shame',  'surprise', these best represent the emotion of the writer. 
 
In this project we will be running a text classification, to understand the emotions between a particular emotion/text, although this is similar to sentiment analysis (this is just base on polarity of Positive, Negative or Neutral) but  emotion detection is we are trying to tell emotion of the writers. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
